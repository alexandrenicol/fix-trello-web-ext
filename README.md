# Fix trello labels web extensions

## why?

On the 14 Septembre 2022 trello release some new labels colours: https://twitter.com/trello/status/1569703802508541952

If like me you don't like the, you can use this web extension to make the labels readable again.

## how to install?

## on firefox:

clone the repo, and follow these steps https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/ (use the zip file in the `web-ext-artifacts` folder)

## on chrome:

clone the repo, and follow these steps https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked (use the repo's root folder)

Once loaded, the extension should enhanced the label automatically on all Trello boards.
